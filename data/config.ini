[DEFAULT]

# Jaeggi-style interface with default scoring model? 
# Choose either this option or JAEGGI_MODE but not both.
# This mode allows access to Manual mode, the extra sound sets, and the
# additional game modes of Brain Workshop while presenting the game in
# the more challenging Jaeggi-style interface featured in the original study.
# With the default BW sequence generation model, the visual and auditory 
# sequences are more randomized and unpredictable than they are in Jaeggi 
# mode.  The only effect of this option is to set the following options:
#   ANIMATE_SQUARES = False, OLD_STYLE_SQUARES = True,
#   OLD_STYLE_SHARP_CORNERS = True, SHOW_FEEDBACK = False,
#   GRIDLINES = False, CROSSHAIRS = True, BLACK_BACKGROUND = True,
#   WINDOW_FULLSCREEN = True, HIDE_TEXT = True, FIELD_EXPAND = True
# Default: False
JAEGGI_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_SCORING = False

# Jaeggi mode?
# Choose either this option or JAEGGI_INTERFACE_DEFAULT_SCORING but not both.
# This mode emulates the scoring model used in the original study protocol.
# It counts non-matches with no inputs as correct (instead of ignoring them).
# It also forces 4 visual matches, 4 auditory matches, and 2 simultaneous
# matches per session, resulting in less randomized and more predictable
# sequences than in the default BW sequence generation model.  
# Different thresholds are used to reflect the modified scoring system 
# (see below).  Access to Manual mode, additional game modes and sound sets 
# is disabled in Jaeggi mode.
# Default: False
JAEGGI_MODE = False

# The default BW scoring system uses the following formula:
#     score = TP / (TP + FP + FN)
# where TP is a true positive response, FN is a false negative, etc.  All
# stimulus modalities are summed together for this formula.  
# The Jaeggi mode scoring system scores uses the following formula:
#     score = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
# Each modality is scored separately, and the score for the whole session
# is equal to the lowest score of any modality.
# Default: False
JAEGGI_SCORING = False

# In Jaeggi Mode, adjust the default appearance and sounds of Brain Workshop
# to emulate the original software used in the study?
# If this is enabled, the following options will be set:

#    SHOW_FEEDBACK = False, GRIDLINES = False, CROSSHAIRS = True
# (note: this option only takes effect if JAEGGI_MODE is set to True)
# Default: True

# In Jaeggi Mode, further adjust the appearance to match the original
# software as closely as possible?
# If this is enabled, the following options will be set:
