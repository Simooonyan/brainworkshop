# Brainworkshop 6

# What is this?
This is a fork of the popular working memory training software BrainWorkshop.  In January 2019 there was a research published that investigates the critical role of interference control training in n-back training games. The paper can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771830218X. I added a new mode "dual position" that incorporates the findings in interference control.
