# Brainworkshop 6

# What is this?
This is a fork of the popular working memory training software BrainWorkshop.  In January 2019 there was a research published that investigates the critical role of interference control training in n-back training games. The paper can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771830218X. I added a new mode "dual position" that incorporates the findings in interference control.

Press A for a position match for the grid. For example, for dual position 2 back, if the grid lines appear in the top left corner, bottom right cornor, and top left corner again, then we should press A because trial 1 matches with trial 3 for the grid.

Press S for a position match for the square. For example, for dual position 2 back, if the square appears in the top right corner, bottom right cornor, and top right corner again, then we should press S because trial 1 matches with trial 3 for the square.
